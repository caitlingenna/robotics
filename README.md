# robotics

Collection of Python code which implements several search and navigation algorithms used in robotics, utilizing sonar and vector field diagrams.
The code can be demonstrated virtually using the Aria toolkit and MobileSim.

The wall avoidance algorithm in particular is designed to be used by a physical robot that has a front-facing ultrasound sensor and four individually motorized wheels.
